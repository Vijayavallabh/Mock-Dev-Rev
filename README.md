# Mock-Dev-Rev
Follow the instructions to run our code - 
1. Download the 'main.py', 'helper.py' and 'prompts.py' files.
2. Enter your API mistral key in the main.py file.
3. Enter your Google gemini api in the Example_datagen.py file.
4. use 'streamlit run main.py' in the terminal.
5. It will ask you to upload the toolset and give the query.

Optional - 
While using the code on a new toolset a query-solution pair needs to be generated and validated by a human. Run the 'Example_Datagen.py' and make the suitable changes to include the new examples in both prompts for a better solution.( Uncomment the code snippet in main.py) 

Precautions - 
The code might sometimes give a JSONDecode error.

Kindly contact 9823965807 - Hrushikesh Kant for any queries in the code as well as errors while running the code.
